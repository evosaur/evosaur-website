		<h1>The Evosaur Project</h1>
		<p>
		<!--TODO: Yeah, we need to write something real in here sometime...-->
		The Evosaur Project intends to be a parent metaproject for alternatives to modern computing, including but not limited to the fields of CPU architectures, operating systems, networking protocols, and userspace programs.

		<h2>Philosophy</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
			Do what the programmer writes.  For example, the compiler MUST NOT do GCC-style optimizations such as replacing <code>printf("Hello, world!\n")</code> with <code>puts("Hello, world!")</code> (C example, we'll use our own language when that happens).  However, as humans often make mistakes (i.e. it is rarely wanted to use <code>printf</code> instead of <code>puts</code> for printing a single string), linters SHOULD be able to detect that (and more subtle issues like double-free, use-after-free, potential buffer overflows, etc) and offer alternatives.  But in no circumstance should the computer do differently than told.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Thoughts</h2>
		<p>
		These are incomplete (as in not complete enough to be in a specification of any kind) thoughts that we had.

		<h2>Licensing</h2>
		<p>
		Unlike most of <a href="https://www.andrewyu.org/">Andrew</a> and <a href="https://users.andrewyu.org/~hax/">Test_User</a>'s Websites, this Website conveys new ideas that may be fundemental to future computing, thus ruling out Public Domain as a ``licensing'' option.  Some type of copyleft will be used but we can't decide which specifically for now.  Until then, please contact <code>evosaur AT andrewyu DOT org</code> for permission to use.  (Basically: For now, <strong>all rights reserved</strong>.)
